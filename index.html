                <p class="answers">
                    Nutri-Grade is a nutrition labeling system introduced 
                    by the Ministry of Health Singapore. It provides information about the sugar content 
                    in beverages, helping consumers make healthier choices. Nutri-Grade “grades” your drinks 
                    based on their sugar and saturated fat levels. Think of this as a combined score. 
                    Drinks graded “A” have the lowest sugar and saturated fat content, while drinks graded “D” have the highest.
